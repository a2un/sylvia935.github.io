Study habits, skills, and behaviors are a group of constructs and factors often studied in relation to academic performance. Existing research provides sufficient evidence that study habits and skills are often reliable predictors for academic success. Due to its influence on student academic performance, it is important to identify and understand both positive and negative study habits so interventions can be designed to support students who are struggling. Students who have poor study habits may lead to reduced academic achievement or contribute to lower retention rates of universities. 

College freshmen, in particular, transition into a new environment that requires more independent academic work, making these study skills and habits a potentially critical factor. Despite the importance of study habits on studentsâ€™ performance, little attention has been given to improving these factors i.e., recommending collaborative work, following a schedule of work etc. Intervention systems that support personal goals and motivate behavioral change have had success in altering user behavior and fostering self-awareness. One such system extensively being used for various interventions are chatbots.

Given this body of literature, we investigated the use of chatbots for influencing study behavior of college freshman. Our research begins with preliminary work surveying students and interviewing tutors to better understand issues and identify opportunities for technological intervention. We use our preliminary results to inform designs for improving student study behavior, and then created a chatbot prototype to help evaluate the designs in a usability study.
