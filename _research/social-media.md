Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) have significantly adopted social media sites, hoping to gain attention and potentially meet their goals such as fundraising and recruiting. By spreading on social media, organizations have potential to retain current audience while simultaneously attract new and young audience (Saxton & Wang, 2013). The use of social media sites for nonprofit organizations can be divided into three categories of communication functions, namely information, community and actions (Lovejoy & Saxton, 2012). Information sharing and community building are only stepping stones for achieving an organization’s ultimate goal – action mobilization. Yet a content analysis of Twitter message reveals that NPOs are devoting most of their communicative efforts on disseminating information rather than creating network or calling for action, and majority of tweets content are not related to an organization's’ core mission (Lovejoy & Saxton, 2012). This appears to be a missed opportunity of social media usage to fulfill organizational mission - social changes in nonprofits’ own field of concentration.
Social media attention is a key prerequisite for achieving organizational goals, since it is through attention, a company can bring up revenue by selling the eyeballs to advertisers and a nonprofit organization is able to disseminate information, build community and mobilize action (Myllylahti, 2018; Guo & Saxton, 2017). From the media economics perspective, attention is seen as a scarce resource. As Parker et al. (2016) point out, attention has become a “currency on the platform” (Parker, Van Alstyne & Choudary, 2016). In order to effectively grab public attention, it is vital for NPOs to understand where the “currency” comes from.

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that harvesting attention on social media may not guarantee desired outcomes (Guo & Saxton, 2017; Hou & Lampe, 2015; Ju, Jeong & Chyi, 2013; Myllylahti, 2018). By investigating social media traffic and social revenue, researchers found that news companies have not earned as much revenue as they expected as a result of the attention they received on social media (Myllylahti, 2018). This reflects that organizations might not have an effective strategy targeting those highly engaged participants. Also, nonprofit organizations are facing the challenge of “clicktivism” or “slacktivism” (Christensen, 2011), in which users regard social media as a button-pressing game without devoting real actions. No matter profit enterprise or nonprofits, organizations are trapped in the attention economy – “keep seeking eyeballs before locating a revenue stream” (Ju, Jeong & Chyi, 2013). To what extent do social media endeavors drive attention to donation remains unclear.

Compared with large nonprofit organizations, small nonprofits are usually facing more challenges given limited funding, time, expertise, lack of control over work (e.g., policy) and constraints in social media management (Hou & Lampe, 2015). Prior studies reveal that social media strategies are more employed by these small, resource-poor NPOs for being heard and building stronger ties with stakeholders and communities (Guo & Saxton, 2013; Hou & Lampe, 2015). But they are suffering from lack of accurate feedback regarding their social media performance. Therefore, if the study provides a reference of effectiveness of different strategies on social media, small nonprofits can allocate their limited financial and management resource in a more effective way.

To address these problems, the focus of this project is to answer these questions:

1) What communication strategies help small nonprofits to capture attention on social media? 

2) What is the relationship between donations small NPOs gain and social media attention?
