Who I Am
======

I'm a Master's student in [Information Science at University of Pittsburgh](https://sci.pitt.edu/) specializing in Human-Centered Computing. I am working with [Dr. Erin Walker](http://erinwalker.owlstown.com/) in Future Adaptive Colaborative Educational Technology(Facet) lab. I am also a Research Intern at Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, where I am supurvised by [Michael Madaio](http://michaelmadaio.com/) and [Dr. Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/). 

At Pitt, I have previously worked with [Dr. Rosta Farzan](http://rosta-farzan.net/) in Sustainable Social Computing lab. I received my bachelor degree in Management Science from [Anhui University](http://en.ahu.edu.cn/). At AHU, I worked in areas of online community and information systems. 

What I Do
======

My research focuses on Learning Technologies and Human-Computer Interaction. I apply human-centered methods to first understand how humans perceive and interact with learning technologies, and then design and implement technology that offers personalized education. 

My past research in these areas has investigated: (a) how nonprofit organizations’ use of social media relates to their fund-raising, (b) how middle school students interact with a pedagogical agent, (c) using conversational interfaces to aid college freshman study habits and skills, and (d) how mobile literacy system impacts children’s early literacy in west Africa. 

I'm currently applying for doctoral programs (Fall, 2020).
