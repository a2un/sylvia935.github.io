Who I Am
-----

I'm a Master's student in [Information Science](https://sci.pitt.edu/) at University of Pittsburgh, specializing in Human-Centered Computing. I am working with [Dr. Erin Walker](http://erinwalker.owlstown.com/) in Future Adaptive Colaborative Educational Technology(Facet) lab. I am also a Research Intern supurvised by [Michael Madaio](http://michaelmadaio.com/) and [Dr. Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) at Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I received my bachelor degree in Management Science from [Anhui University](http://en.ahu.edu.cn/), where I worked in areas of online community and information systems. 

What I Do
-----

My research focuses on Education Technologies and Human-Computer Interaction. I apply human-centered methods to first understand how humans perceive and interact with learning technologies, and then design and implement technology that offers personalized education. 

My research particularly aims to answer a key question: **How can we design social, collaborative learning environments to improve student motivation and provide personalized learning experiences?** Computer-aided learning systems can do more than just present proper pedagogical feedback, but be able to provide affective and engaging learning experiences to the users. For example, my [past research]() has investigated a) how middle school students manage rapport with a social, teachable robot, b) using conversational interfaces to aid college freshman study habits and skills, and (c) how mobile literacy system impacts childrenâ€™s early literacy in west Africa.

I'm currently applying for doctoral programs (Fall, 2020).
