Who I Am
-----

I'm a Master's student in [Information Science](https://sci.pitt.edu/) at University of Pittsburgh, specializing in Human-Centered Computing. I am working with [Dr. Erin Walker](http://erinwalker.owlstown.com/) in Future Adaptive Colaborative Educational Technology(Facet) lab. I am also a Research Intern supurvised by [Michael Madaio](http://michaelmadaio.com/) and [Dr. Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) at Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I received my bachelor degree in Management Science from [Anhui University](http://en.ahu.edu.cn/). 

In Fall 2020, I will become a PhD student in [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) at University of Florida, where I will be joining Dr. [Kristy Boyer](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/learndialogue/person.php?id=keboyer)'s group! 

What I Do
-----

My research focuses on Education Technologies and Human-Computer Interaction. I apply human-centered methods to first understand how humans perceive and interact with learning technologies, and then design and implement technology that offers personalized education. 

My research particularly aims to answer a key question: **How can we design social, collaborative learning environments to improve student motivation and provide personalized learning experiences?** Computer-aided learning systems can do more than just present proper pedagogical feedback, but be able to provide affective and engaging learning experiences to the users.
