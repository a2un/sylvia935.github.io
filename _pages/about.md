About Me
======
------
I'm a Master's student in [Information Science at University of Pittsburgh](https://sci.pitt.edu/) specializing in Human-Centered Computing. Currently I am working with [Dr. Erin Walker](http://erinwalker.owlstown.com/) under the field of human-robot interaction.  Previously, I worked with [Dr. Rosta Farzan](http://rosta-farzan.net/), studying the effectiveness of nonprofit organizationsâ€™ social media usage. I received my bachelor degree in Management Science from [Anhui University](http://en.ahu.edu.cn/). At AHU, I worked in areas of online community and information systems. 

My research interest lies on the field of human-computer interaction in the context of education. I am broadly interested in understanding how technology help facilitate learning process. The fields such as human-computer interaction, intelligent tutoring system, information retrieval and NLP appeal to me. 

I'm currently in preparation for applying doctoral programs (Fall, 2020). It is important for me to generate new knowledge that lead greater social impact.
