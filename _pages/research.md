*StudyBuddy*: A Chatbot Designing for College Freshman Study Habits 
[image here]
In the transition to a new stage of learning, college freshmen are in specific need of developing their study habits and skills to achieve independent work in higher education. Collaborating with three students and [Dr. Jacob Biehl](https://jtbiehl.github.io/), we designed a chatbot *StudyBuddy* to support freshman’s behavoiral change. We administered interviews with peer tutors and surveys freshmen at Pitt’s CS department, which we found students have difficulties managing their project and time. We built prototypes in both high fedality over Slack and low fedality as storyboards. To evaluate a chatbot's role in support learning, we conducted cognitive walkthrough studies with both senior and first-year CS students. 

*Emma*: 

a project under the supervision of [Dr. Erin Walker]() to investigate middle school students’ rapport (a sense of harmony) with a robot who speaks socially. I coded rapport using linguistic cues among the human-robot dialogue and observed individuals’ different reaction patterns with the robot. The study informed the human rapport theory as it provided insight into whether human rapport could be translated into human-robot interactions and why.
